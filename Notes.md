use simple models on smaller data

scikit - simple models
TensorFlow, PyTorch - complex models

Trad is Data + Program -> Output
ML is Data + Output -> Program

features = attributes = independent variables

all input data must be numeric

ML models: Predictive and Generative

GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer
